## About this fork

Rehman-PDF is a **fork of [storytold/pdfcraft](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft)'s open-source PDF engine** (dual-licensed MIT OR Apache-2.0), pinned at its **v0.9.0** release. It is not a rebrand of an unrelated product: every page you render, every combine and split, runs on PdfCraft's Rust engine, with full credit to its authors.

What makes this fork different is that it **speaks your language**:

- **Urdu (`ur`) interface localization** — the whole UI in Urdu, following the same i18n pattern the engine already uses for its 22 interface languages (including Arabic with full right-to-left layout).
- **Right-to-left text editing** — the engine's own roadmap admits editing right-to-left text is a real gap; this fork works on closing it.
- **Urdu text extraction** — reading-order-correct extraction from real Urdu PDFs, including Nastaleeq faces, with a committed test corpus so regressions stay fixed.

This is **alpha software**: honest about what it can and cannot do yet, like the engine it is built on. See [What's next](#whats-next).

## Community

Rehman-PDF is maintained in the open at **[github.com/iRehmanAhmad/Rehman-PDF](https://github.com/iRehmanAhmad/Rehman-PDF)**. The fastest way to get help, report a bug or follow development is the repo's issue tracker. The engine this fork builds on comes from [storytold/pdfcraft](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft), and bug fixes useful to everyone flow back upstream.

## Highlights

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### Faithful
Real-world typography: Urdu and Arabic scripts, complex scripts, colour emoji, gradients, soft masks and transparency. All of it renders the way the author intended.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### Fearless
Every save appends your changes and leaves the original bytes untouched. Writes are atomic, undo runs deep, and nothing is lost if you close by mistake.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### Yours
No account, no telemetry, no cloud. It works offline and opens instantly. The engine, CLI and app are all open source.

## Read anything, beautifully

Rehman-PDF renders PDFs with care for the details that make a page feel right: kerning and ligatures, right-to-left and complex scripts, colour emoji, shadings, blend modes, soft masks and optional content.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-scripts.png" alt="The Scripts of the World page: Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, Thai, Greek, Cyrillic, Chinese, Korean, IPA, Armenian, Georgian and Tamil samples, with vertical Japanese in the right margin" width="100%">
  <br>
  <sub>Twelve writing systems on one page, plus vertical Japanese, at 125%.</sub>
</p>

- **Deep zoom stays sharp.** Large pages render in tiles, so text stays crisp at any magnification.
- **Built to survive bad files.** Every page renders in isolation and damaged documents are repaired. Across the 983-file pdf.js test corpus the result is 0 crashes.
- **Layouts for every task:** continuous, single page, two-up, view rotation, full screen and a distraction-free Read mode.
- **Light and dark themes**, both designed to be easy on the eyes for long sessions.

## Find it, select it, copy it

Search the whole document as you type, step through matches with <kbd>⌘G</kbd>, and select text that comes out in the right reading order. That holds for columns, right-to-left runs and Urdu too.

## Navigate long documents

Right-click a PDF tab to close it, reopen the last closed file-backed tab, or reveal its file. Closing still asks about unsaved changes. Reopening reads the saved file from disk; it does not restore discarded edits. Reveal selects the file in Explorer or Finder. On Linux and FreeBSD it requests `org.freedesktop.FileManager1.ShowItems`, falling back to opening the containing directory with `xdg-open` when that service is unavailable. Reopen and Reveal are unavailable on the web; Reveal is also unavailable for pathless documents.

Bookmarks, page thumbnails and the document's own page labels (i, ii, 1, 2…) keep you oriented in long documents. Search bookmark titles in the Bookmarks panel to find nested entries even when their parents are collapsed. Matches keep their ancestors for context; Clear restores the unfiltered tree without changing its expansion state.

</tr>
</table>

## Organize pages like cards on a table

Open **Organize pages** to see every page at once:
- **Select pages:** click, <kbd>⌘</kbd>-click or <kbd>⇧</kbd>-click.
- **Change them:** rotate, delete, insert blank pages, insert pages from another file, and move them earlier or later.
- **Undo anything:** <kbd>⌘Z</kbd>, then save.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-organize.png" alt="The Organize pages grid with the showcase's pages as thumbnails, three of them selected, and the page toolbar above" width="100%">
  <br>
  <sub>Organize pages with three pages selected and the page tools in the toolbar above.</sub>
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Undo that goes the distance.** Each change is one step in a history you can walk backwards and forwards. The Edit menu names the step ("Undo Rotate pages"), and undo still works after you save.

**Saves you can trust:**
- *Incremental:* the original bytes stay byte-for-byte intact.
- *Atomic:* the file is written to a temporary copy, then swapped in.
- *Verified:* independently checked with qpdf, on every CI run.

When open documents exceed the window width, scroll over the tab strip with the mouse wheel or trackpad, or use its horizontal scrollbar. Opening or switching to a document brings its tab into view.

Unsaved documents carry a dot on their tab, and closing or quitting asks before anything is lost. Changes are autosaved every minute. If the app ever quits unexpectedly, it offers to recover your work the next time it opens. Encrypted documents stay encrypted on disk.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-split.png" alt="The Split document dialog over the organize view, set to one page per file and reporting that it creates 13 files from 13 pages"><br><sub>Split document: one page per file makes 13 files.</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>

## Combine and split without losing a thing

**Combine files** merges any number of PDFs into one. Each file gets a bookmark, with its own bookmarks nested underneath.

**Extract** copies the pages you select into a new document. **Split** divides a document every *n* pages, or before the pages you choose.

Nothing quietly disappears along the way:
- links and named destinations are rewired to the copied pages;
- form fields stay interactive;
- layers keep their on/off defaults;
- attachments come along.

Every page of a combined document renders pixel-identical to its source.

```sh
pdfcraft-cli combine report.pdf appendix.pdf --out combined.pdf
pdfcraft-cli extract report.pdf --pages 1,3,5-8 --out highlights.pdf
pdfcraft-cli split   report.pdf --every 10 --out-dir parts/
```

---

## Open protected documents and respect their rules

The engine implements the PDF standard security handler completely:
- every revision, from 40-bit RC4 to AES-256;
- user and owner passwords, including Unicode passwords normalised with SASLprep;
- crypt filters and attachment-only encryption.

Documents restricted by their author show a clear notice, and the app honours their permissions. Enter the owner password and the restrictions lift. Edits to encrypted documents are saved encrypted, under the same keys.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-properties.png" alt="The Document Properties dialog on its Description tab, with editable title, author, subject and keywords, and tabs for Security, Fonts and Advanced"><br><sub>Document Properties, Description tab</sub></td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Document Properties** shows:
- the document's title, author, subject and keywords, which you can edit;
- the fonts it uses and whether each is embedded;
- PDF version, page size, tags, fields, layers and attachments;
- the full security picture: encryption method, which password opened it, and each permission.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Comments, forms, layers and attachments

<td width="50%"><img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-forms.png" alt="The Interactive Form page with highlighted text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, a list and a signature field, and the Fields panel listing all 13 fields and their values"></td>

<td valign="top"><b>Layers</b>: switch optional content on and off and the page re-renders instantly. <b>Comments</b> appear as threaded conversations, and <b>attachments</b> can be opened or saved.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Every tool, one keystroke away

Press <kbd>⌘K</kbd> to search every tool and command, or browse the **All tools** catalogue. Tools that are still in development are marked with the milestone that will ship them.

## Runs everywhere, stays yours

- **Native on macOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD**, and **in the browser** through WebAssembly, from the same Rust codebase. Windows builds come for x64, x86 and ARM64 (Windows on ARM, no emulation); every ARM64 change is tested on ARM64 hardware in CI.
- **Private by design.** Documents never leave your machine. There's no account, no telemetry and no cloud processing.
- **Engine first.** Parsing, rendering and editing live in reusable library crates. The interface is one swappable layer on top.
- **Scriptable.** The `pdfcraft-cli` tool (see [Built for agents, too](#built-for-agents-too)) covers inspecting, rendering, extracting text, editing, combining, extracting pages and splitting. Robustness sweeps run on the same engine as the app.

```sh
pdfcraft-cli info  form.pdf                                  # structure as JSON
pdfcraft-cli text  paper.pdf --page 3                        # reading-order text
pdfcraft-cli edit  in.pdf --rotate 1,2:90 --delete 5 --title "Q3" --out out.pdf
```

---

## Built for agents, too

Every engine feature is reachable without the GUI, through one table of JSON-Schema-described tools: open, inspect, render pages to PNG, extract and find text, rotate, delete, move and insert pages, edit bookmarks and page labels, add, reply to, restyle and delete comments (highlight a phrase just by naming it), list and fill in form fields, protect with passwords, set metadata, undo and redo, save, combine, extract and split. Three front doors share it:

- **`pdfcraft-cli run`**, for one-off calls and JSON scripts:

  ```sh
  pdfcraft-cli tools                                        # every tool and its JSON Schema
  pdfcraft-cli run text_find doc=1 query=invoice            # key=value; values parse as JSON
  pdfcraft-cli run --script review.json                     # e.g. comment_add {"type": "highlight", "find": "total due"}
  pdfcraft-cli run --script steps.json --root ./work        # several steps in one session
  pdfcraft-cli run --script steps.json --report             # one JSON document: per step its number, tool, status, result or error
  ```

  With `--root`, every file the script's steps read or write stays in that directory, including the PNG a step saves with `"out"` (the script itself is read from wherever you name it).

- **An MCP server**, for AI agents such as Claude. **It is opt-in:** the app never starts it on its own, and it opens no network port. It runs only while an agent launches `pdfcraft-cli mcp`, talks over stdin/stdout, and stops when the agent disconnects. To enable it, add it to your agent's MCP configuration:

  ```json
  { "mcpServers": { "rehman-pdf": { "command": "pdfcraft-cli", "args": ["mcp", "--root", "/path/to/your/pdfs"] } } }
  ```

  `--compact` shrinks the tool list the agent has to read: `tools/list` returns about ten core tools plus `tool_search` and `tool_call`, which find and run every other tool, so the list costs far fewer tokens. Every tool still works.

  `--root` confines every file the agent can read or write to one directory. Builds that should not include the server at all can use `cargo build -p pdfcraft-cli --no-default-features`.

- **The Rust API** (`pdfcraft_automation::Automation::call`), for embedding.

Edits stay in memory, undoable, until `doc_save`. Saving to the same file appends an incremental update, so the original bytes are preserved, and the write is atomic. Unsaved changes are never discarded silently.

### Driving the app itself

Start the desktop app with `pdfcraft --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json` and an agent can see and operate the real interface: the widget tree with labels and positions (from the accessibility tree), clicks, typing, keys, commands, view options and screenshots. This is also off by default. It listens only on loopback, and every connection must present the random token written to that file, which only you can read.

Keep the control file in a folder only you can write, not a shared one such as `/tmp`: another user could create the file there first and receive your commands. `pdfcraft-cli ui` refuses a control file that is a symbolic link, and on macOS, Linux and FreeBSD one that another user owns or can read or write. The app doesn't start if it can't write the file.

```sh
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json inspect query=rotate      # find widgets
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json click label="Organize pages"
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json key key=K modifiers='["command"]'
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json command id=comment.square   # pick a tool, then draw:
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json drag from='[400,300]' to='[600,420]'
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json screenshot --out window.png
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json resize width=1200 height=800
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json focus label="Read"
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json inspect focused=true
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json quit
```

See the engine's README section upstream for the full `ui.dock` panel operations reference.

## How it's built

Rehman-PDF inherits a Cargo workspace of focused crates, layered so the core never depends on the UI:

| Crate | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pdfcraft-filters` | Every PDF stream filter (Flate, LZW, ASCII85, RunLength, predictors), encode and decode, property-tested |
| `pdfcraft-crypt` | The standard security handler: RC4, AES-128/256, revisions 2–6, permissions |
| `pdfcraft-cos` | The PDF object layer: tolerant parsing, repair, copy-on-write edits, incremental and full writing |
| `pdfcraft-organize` | Page operations, combine / extract / split, bookmarks, page labels, document information |
| `pdfcraft-fonts` | Font metrics and encodings for generated appearances |
| `pdfcraft-annot` | Comments: builders and appearance streams for notes, text markup, shapes, ink and text boxes; replies, status, edits |
| `pdfcraft-forms` | Interactive forms: the field model, filling with regenerated appearances, Clear form |
| `pdfcraft-render` | Rendering, inspection and text extraction with reading order |
| `pdfcraft-engine` | The façade every frontend uses: sessions, edits, undo, saving, the tool catalogue |
| `pdfcraft-automation` | Agent control: the headless tool table, `pdfcraft-cli run`, and the opt-in MCP server |
| `pdfcraft-ui-egui` | The desktop and web interface |

**Quality gates.** Every change passes the same automated checks:
- formatting, and Clippy with warnings as errors;
- 200+ unit, property and UI tests;
- crate-layering rules and a WebAssembly build check;
- an asset-licence audit.

On top of those, two corpus sweeps run over real-world files:
- **Opening and rendering:** of the 983 pdf.js test files, 963 open and render cleanly, with 0 crashes.
- **Open, edit and save round trips:** 958 succeed.

The output is verified against independent implementations: hayro and qpdf on every CI run, and
poppler over the corpus on demand (`cargo xtask text-oracle`).

The engine is a clean-room implementation. Its behaviour comes from the ISO 32000 specification and black-box observation, never from anyone else's code. Every icon, font and image is openly licensed and listed in [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Get started

Building needs Rust 1.95 or later.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iRehmanAhmad/Rehman-PDF
cd Rehman-PDF
cargo xtask models                                # fetch the OCR models Scan & OCR needs (release builds include them)
cargo run --release -p pdfcraft -- some.pdf     # desktop app
cargo xtask demo-pdf                              # build the showcase PDF used in these screenshots
cargo xtask screenshots                           # regenerate every screenshot in this README
```

The interface language is chosen in **Menu → Edit → Preferences…** (Command-comma on macOS,
Ctrl-comma elsewhere, also with no document open; Auto follows the system language;
see [docs/localization.md](docs/localization.md)) and saved. The engine already ships 22 interface
languages, including Arabic with full right-to-left layout; the fork's goal is to add **Urdu**
to that same list.

> [!NOTE]
> In this pinned v0.9.0 build the binaries are still named `pdfcraft` and `pdfcraft-cli` (the upstream names); a rename ships with the first Rehman-PDF release. All CLI examples on this page use those names and work as written.

Logs, environment variables and other development notes are in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## What's next

Rehman-PDF is young and moving fast. The aim is the PDF workbench Pakistani teachers, students and offices actually reach for: view, organize, annotate, fill, sign and edit PDFs — **in Urdu, first**.

**Where it stands (October 2026), honestly:** this fork is **alpha**, inheriting the engine's state. Most of Acrobat Pro's offline features exist in some form (57% of all tracked features, 94% of the must-haves). For everyday work (viewing, commenting, filling and signing forms, organizing pages) it is about 55% of the way to replacing Acrobat; against all of Acrobat Pro, about 49%; for someone who only needs the essentials, about 66%. Every everyday workflow can be completed, but converting and sharing is weak: no Office-to-PDF, and Word export that loses layout.

- **Good today:** viewing and search; organizing, combining and splitting; most kinds of comment; filling and authoring forms (with sandboxed JavaScript); passwords, redaction and sanitizing; basic digital signatures; printing; the Accessibility Checker; agent control through the CLI and MCP.
- **Still borrowed:** pages are drawn by the `hayro` crate while our own renderer is built.
- **Thin or missing:** reliable editing of existing text (especially CJK and right-to-left — the gap this fork exists to close), OCR beyond Latin script, Office import/export, signature tokens and online long-term validation, Preflight and PDF/X/UA, printing from the web build, physical printer fidelity, and full XFA forms.
- **Hardening:** fuzzing still turns up crashes and hangs on hostile files; each one is fixed with a regression test. Quality has not yet been compared with Acrobat side by side.

**Next, in order:** the Urdu interface locale, right-to-left text-editing fixes with regression tests, Urdu text-extraction parity on a committed test corpus, then the engine's own roadmap order: Office-to-PDF and a Word export that keeps layout, the reported bugs, a fidelity harness, and 1.0 polish.

The summary is in **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)**; the full assessment by dimension and area is in [docs/target-app-parity.md](docs/target-app-parity.md), the ranked gaps in [docs/gaps.md](docs/gaps.md), and the milestones in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## Downloads

**Want to try it?** Rehman-PDF does not publish installers or release builds yet — it is alpha, and the first release is a Phase 2 decision. To use it today, **build from source** with the steps under [Get started](#get-started). Release artifacts (signed installers and portable builds for each platform) come later, announced in this repo's releases.
